// d3d9_raster.h - a CPU renderer for the Direct3D 9 device.
//
// It reads the pipeline record (d3d9_pipeline.h): the bound vertex and pixel
// shader bytecode, their constant registers and the texture behind each
// sampler. It runs the vertex shader on every vertex, rasterizes the
// triangles into the device's 32-bit render target with perspective-correct
// attributes, and runs the pixel shader on every covered pixel. Shader models
// 1.1 to 2.0 without flow control are interpreted; anything else is refused
// with a message rather than drawn wrongly.
//
// This is the correctness path, not the fast one: it exists so the first
// image comes from the game's own shaders, and so a GPU path has something to
// be compared against.
